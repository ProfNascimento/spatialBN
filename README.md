# Spatiotemporal BN

This work proposed a low-computation cost framework that unleashes the Bayesian Network (BN) to include a spatiotemporal factor which helps to understand the effectiveness of a global pattern, as well as individual location (as clusters) measures. This new spatial-temporal Bayesian Network model includes a two-step procedure; i) spatial pattern extraction via Tabu metaheuristic (as a vague prior) or geographical distances using the Bayes Factor (as an informative prior), and then ii) ARIMA temporal filtering step. As a social network case, epidemiological COVID-19 incidence data information was considered based on 26 weekly Brazilian states and the Federal District, between 02/25/2020 and 02/15/2022. This approach used, as spatial-prior information, the distances across the five geographical regions. Results from the proposed model unraveled the spatial dependence between regions, from the COVID-19 incidence spread contribution rate.
